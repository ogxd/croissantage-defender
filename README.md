# ⚔️🥐🥐🥐 Croissantage Defender 🥐🥐🥐⚔️

In france, forgetting to lock your laptop can get you "croissanted" from a colleague. Croissanting someone implies using his unlocked laptop to post on his own name on the company slack an invitation for having croissant next morning.   

Of course, you can just not forget to lock your laptop, but we're here to make shitware and useless programs so here is a tool to help you not get croissanted.

## But how does it works?

It will simply block all keyboard / mouse inputs until the password is typed. Functionally speaking, this is not very different from locking your computer, except that the screen will still show your opened windows, so it will bait your colleagues, who are just here waiting for an opportunity to do a croissantage.   
Fortunately, they will quickly realize that they actually can't do anything, and, by baiting them over and over, they will get used to it and not longer try, even for the few times where you actually forgot to lock for real (evil laugh)

## How to use it?

Don't.
